#hCard Validator

Conformance checker for the [hCard microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard).

It's a tool written in a mix of PHP and XSLT that checks hCards against the specification.

##Live demo

You can use live version at [hcard.geekhood.net](http://hcard.geekhood.net/).

##TODO

* hCard validator doesn't support latest version of the spec with value class pattern.
* other microformats are not supported. I'd like this project to evolve into conformance checker for all microformats.
